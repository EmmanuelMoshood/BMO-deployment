##Exercise:
The Application Engineering team has been developing a custom WooCommerce-based product which will need to be deployed for this initiative. As a member of the DevOps Engineering team your job will be to create the cloud-based infrastructure for supporting this deployment. You will need to create a reference architecture and implement it using modern IaC techniques with documentation for 3-tier application. You can use serverless or container technology or VMs to implement this.
