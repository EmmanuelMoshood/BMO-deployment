# WooCommerce Deployment Infrastructure

## Overview:
As a member of the DevOps Engineering team, I have designed and implemented the cloud-based infrastructure to support the deployment of a custom WooCommerce-based product. To make the project more contextual, I have also assumed based on the nature of most WooCommerce applications that the product is most likely not broken up into microservices instead it is most likely an application powered by WooCommerce and using a frontend framework like react. 
The infrastructure will be based on a 3-tier application architecture consisting of web, application, and database tiers. Modern Infrastructure as Code (IaC) technique has been utilized for deployment using Terraform and container technology to deploy the frontend and backend applications have been used. In addition, the deployment is created to be scalable and highly available in multiple availability zones. Seen the architectural diagram for reference.
